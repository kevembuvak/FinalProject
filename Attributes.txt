class RequiredPropertyAttribute: Attribute
{

}

Used to decrease the amount of code written in a method, and to code clean.

For example:

class Stuff
{
	[RequiredProperty]  ----> codes are not written here, it looks cleaner
	public string Hello {get; set;}
}

it can also be above the class

[ToTable("parameter")]
class Stuff2{}

in order to have a parameter in a attribute, you have to put a ctor in it

class ToTableAttribute: Attribute
{
	public ToTable("parameter")
	{
		
	}
}
